# APIs

## Definition

Definitions
- In computer programming, an application programming interface (API) is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building application software.
- An API is usually related to a software library. The API describes and prescribes the expected behavior (a specification) while the library is an actual implementation of this set of rules.
- Remote APIs allow developers to manipulate remote resources through protocols, specific standards for communication that allow different technologies to work together, regardless of language or platform. 
- Web APIs are the defined interfaces through which interactions happen between an enterprise and applications that use its assets.
- Operating system APIs are typically integrated into the software development kit for the corresponding program.
- An API is a software-to-software interface, not a user interface. With APIs, applications talk to each other without any user knowledge or intervention. 

Pros
- Using APIs is fast
- Most popular APIs and services are so highly extended that have been tested in all kinds of stress, so we can ensure that your response will be adequate in the vast majority of cases.
- When users often use a good service, just recognizing and associating our image to that of a big as Google, Facebook or Twitter, can help infect the good perception that users have of these giants.
- Generally, large companies that their products will not deteriorate, so it is not uncommon for services accessed through the APIs are in a constant improvement, also in many cases will be totally transparent to the programmer that uses them.
- Innovation of leading companies like Microsoft, eBay or Amazon will not conform to keep their applications to work well, but will try to improve steadily, so that users of its APIs will benefit all improvements as they occur.
- APIs enable mobile, the Internet of Things, the connected car, and how you can work more easily with your partners. Your partners are looking to access your products and services faster via fewer clicks. The easiest and securest way to do this is with an API. Read: API equals efficiency.
- A free API is a great way to create stickiness with your product or service and can even encourage developers to build apps and integrations right on top of your API, making it even stickier. Like all free things, it’s a great way to get people to start using your API, knowing that it increases the chances of them paying later.
 
Cons
- An important factor when an API becomes public is its interface stability. Changes by a developer to a part of it—for example adding new parameters to a function call—could break compatibility with clients that depend on that API.
- A very logical question to consider is whether anyone would use your API if your company decides to offer one.
- Some of the first concerns that comes up when an API is suggested are that it could take more time to support than it’s worth and that, secretly perhaps, companies are wary of inviting outside developers into a messy code base they are embarrassed about.
- When you link us to a third party to a contract as weak as is a license to use API , we are normally exposed to the will of the other party, which may mean cuts in benefits, methods implemented obsolescence or loss of free service.
